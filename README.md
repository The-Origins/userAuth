This is an api with user authentification. The first api i created had an extremely primitive version and this on is the new
and improved version after I took a course on user auth.

You will need:
    - Nodejs -> https://nodejs.org/en
    - Mongodb -> https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell
    - run npm install to install dependancies
    - create your own .env file with its own values

NOTE: This version of the api has a gui and can be used on a browser.
